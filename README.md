# CS701TermProject

Project for CS 701 Rich Internet Application Development. 

Name: Student Reg Tool

Live app: https://studentregtool.web.app/

Description: Web application to keep track of student records and registration procedures. The application allows students to search for courses offered in an academic term, save them to a schedule, and register for them. The registration data is saved to the student’s account and can be retrieved at another session. In the future, I would like to re work the project by making the user interface more robust and setting permissions for administrator versus student roles.
